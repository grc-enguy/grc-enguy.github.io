        <h1>Aktiv Grotesk vs. Acumin </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Aktiv Grotesk</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->

             <p>Aktiv Grotesk is a sans-serif font designed by the typeface design studio Dalton Maag. Swiss type designer Bruno Maag wanted to create a font that acted as an alternative to Helvetica as he considered it overused and lacking in various aspects. He would eventually release Aktiv Grotesk in 2010, a font that some described as the "Helvetica killer." The font separated itself from the quirks of Helvetica while sporting personality, creating a versatile typeface that works for both digital and print applications.</p>
             
			 <h3>Acumin</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Acumin is a sans-serif font designed by renowned type designer Robert Slimbach. Its design is Slimbach's take on the neo-grotesque category: a style of typography that has been present for over a century best represented by Helvetica and Univers. He intended Acumin to not be just an iteration of the neo-grotesque style, but rather its own identity as a neo-grotesque typeface. Acumin would eventually be published through Adobe in 2015 with many praises to its design and readability, even being descibed as "Helvetica for readers" by designer Jeffrey Zeldman.</p>
